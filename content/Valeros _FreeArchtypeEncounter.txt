Valeros

You're in a training ground, obviously practicing battle.  A grizzled old dwarf stands in front of you.  "Dammit, boy!" he growls, rubbing his head.  You had run off on your own again, leaving him to take a blow or let an enemy get away or whatever it was you were practicing today.  "You're not the only one on the battlefield.  You're going to be fighting with allies.  You can't forget them!"  *deep breath*  "You're not meant for the town guard. You're not meant from Absolom.  You've not the temperment for it, no.  But more than that, you're too good for them.  You can be at the center of the fight. But you need to be aware. And you need to decide what you want to do there.  Do you want to be a leader, or do you want all the eyes on you?
