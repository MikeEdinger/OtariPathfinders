Rogue

Background
**

Penelope grew up in a community of other rogues surrounded by a close-knit family in Otari who enjoyed many years of traditions. Her parents and siblings were very supportive, but they followed a life that seemed too routine for Penelope. With her family’s blessing, and with the hope that she would one day return, Penelope left her family at the age of 18 and ventured out on a nomad-like journey.

  

Spending a few years on her own in a makeshift hut concealed from the public, Penelope still sought out somewhat of a connection to her peers – missing the relationships she once cultivated. Penelope made a living through small, odd jobs at a shop in a diverse area of town, and by being somewhat of a vigilante for those who could not fend for themselves – though she doesn’t share much about these small acts. She learned about herself and honed some abilities with her rapier, while also dabbling in a bit of magic. Penelope, now 23, wishes she had focused on her language abilities while on her own, especially after running into diverse groups throughout the years, but she is happy to be with her current group.
