Fighter

Background: **

Valeros Vos was born on an orchard in the Hamlet of Immensby, a logging settlement just outside the town of Otari along the Southern Coast of the Isle of Kortos. He is the youngest son of Valen Vos, Sr. and Lorelai Catavorna. Val's parents raised their four boys to be farmers, but in time it became apparent that the family’s meager means could not support all of the children and their future families. Pragmatically, the two older boys, Valen Jr. and Vahn, were kept in the family trade while the younger two, Viggo and Val, were largely written off. 

  

Absent a dowry or the prospect of inheriting a portion of the family land the younger boys were left with little hope for a domestic future. Viggo moved to Absalom to be a priest of Cayden Cailean and Val was left to do menial labor around the orchard. Shortly after his 15th birthday, Val convinced a retired Pathfinder, Khoumrock Blackthane, to teach him in the ways of war. 

  

Val served as an apprentice to Blackthane for three years. The old dwarf quickly recognized that young Val did not have the discipline nor temperament to find a posting in the First Guard of Absalom; so, the old dwarf began to prepare Val for a career in the Pathfinder Society. Now 18, Val has been adventuring around Otari for several months with three relatively like-minded aspiring adventurers.
