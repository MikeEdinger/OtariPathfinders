Cleric (Sarenrae)

**

Kyra Merritt is an Otari native. Her coastal, trade port hometown always offered interesting sites, smells, and new beings to watch. The only child to parents who ran a modestly successful general store in Otari Market, Kyra grew up quietly observing from behind the counters and later helping staff the front. Her parents felt it important that Kyra receive an education so when not assisting at the store she could regularly be found at the temple to Sarenrae in the West of the city. 

  

Here she fell in love with learning, eagerly reading anything new that came into the temple's library and studying under the temple clergy's guidance. Head priestess Banderdash's passion and kindness inspired Kyra to take up her role as cleric in the church's ministry. Now 19, she finds great fulfillment in her role as healer but longed for the variety in life she imagines adventuring can bring. Besides, anyone who works customer service during their formative years is destined to seek out something different…and perhaps knock a few heads together along the way.
