Room 1 - The room was once a comfortable sitting room with two chairs and a low end table.  In a vision, a woman you recognize as [[Belcorra]] is meeting with a [[Vollluk|a dark skinned elf (drow)]]. Belcorra is speaking animatedly about something. In the corner is a glowing, whispy entity with glowing eyes swirling around a black vortex.  The drow alternates between listening attentatively and looking suspicious of the entity in the corner. The entity, while it doesn't have a face, appears to have much admiration and desire to please Belcorra.

Room 2 - The vision in this room is one of two plush divans.  In one, Belcorra reads a book (The Whispering Reeds).  In the other, the same entity as the previous room.  This time, curled up in the other divan, like a cat.

Room 3 - A well-set table reveals this to have once been Belcorraâ€™s private dining room. In the image, she sits at the table, drinking a glass of wine and enjoying an elegantly plated roast arm that looks disturbingly human.  She is talking to the entity.  The entity appears to be communicating back.
