Blue Finley (Finn) is a ghost living in the fishing camp.  Finn wanted to be an adventurer like his grandmother, but was too timid.  He drowned attempting to rescue a child and became a ghost that haunted the fishing camp.  He is quiet and depressed (like Eyore). It is unclear whether or not he can leave his room.

[[The party]] has befriended him.  He looks after the camp with [[Olli]] and [[Tangletop]] and is helping raise [[The Puppies]].  He has shown the party where his grandmother's sword is.


[[Missions]]
The party has a mission to help Finn become corporeal enough to cuddle with the puppies.
