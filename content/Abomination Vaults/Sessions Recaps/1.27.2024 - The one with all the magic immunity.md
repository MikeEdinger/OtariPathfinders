Session opened with [[The Party]] entering [[Belcorra]]'s hidden personal chambers.  In each room, they were confronted with various visions of Belcorra doing relatively mundane things - conversing with a lieutenant, reading a book, and enjoying a meal - but all twisted with evil.  Each vision also contained an evil entity that the party discovered was a powerful Will-o-the-Wisp like creature.  With a very informative Recall Knowledge Roll from [[Turonio]], a clutch Bless from [[Kyra]], strategic positioning to put the creature off guard from [[Penelope]], and some hot dice from [[Val]], the party was able to defeat it fairly easily (this GM was quite a bit worried about the encounter before the session).

As a reward, the party found quite the treasure trove.  An arcane rose gold ring, pristine white gloves, a fancy looking crossbow, and an ostentatious cloak.

Moving on, the party finally found the source of the mysterious green ribbon of light, the ghost of [[Otari Ilvashti]].  But before they could speak with him, they fought more flickerwhisps and an actual Will-o-the-Wisp.  They were easily dispatched with the help of Otari, but not without Val be afflicted (again - Vandy is going to be so disappointed) by some weird disease.

Upon speaking to Otari, they learned about his final hours.  They shared with him the ultimate fate of his companions, which brought him great peace.  He implored the party to stop Belcorra and to destroy Gauntlight, which they pledged to do.  The party also learned of another of Belcorra's lieutenants, [[Volluk]] He also gave them guidance on how to drop the magical barrier and continue downward into the dungeon.  They must find the four icons of the Roseguard, one of which was given to them by Otari.

The party continued on to the last unexplored area of the 4th floor, where they encountered Volluk, the seemingly one enemy who didn't have magic immunity.  He was defeated and with a Lord of the Dance esque tap performance by Penelope, his remnants were destroyed and was certain to not return.

The party opened a door and came face to face with [[Khoumrock Blackthane]], who was trapped in a cold, spectral blue light and screaming in agony.
